# Notes

This script, Notes, is intended for me personally to start up my preferred editor and organise thefile tree (documents/ntnu/..etc..etc..) with only a few button presses.
This is not perfectly made and will be improved on when I have ideas.

One way to use scripts can be:
1. 'chmod  755 notes'    set permissions
2. 'cp notes /usr/bin'   make Notes available globally for user
3. '$ notes -s <subject>'   Run with param -s and name subject
